# Digit_recognizer

## Summary of the Two Models Used

### 1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

**Architecture:**

- **Flatten Layer:** Converts each 28x28 pixel image into a 1D array of 784 values.
- **Dense Layer (Hidden Layer):** Contains 128 neurons with ReLU activation, introducing non-linearity and enabling the network to learn complex patterns.
- **Dropout Layer:** A dropout rate of 20% to prevent overfitting by randomly setting 20% of the neurons to zero during each training step.
- **Dense Layer (Output Layer):** Contains 10 neurons with Softmax activation to output a probability distribution across the 10 digit classes (0-9).

**Purpose:**

- **General Classification:** Used for basic classification tasks. Suitable for simpler problems and smaller datasets where the spatial structure of the data is not as important.

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

**Architecture:**

- **Convolutional Layers:** Three layers with increasing numbers of filters (32, 64, 64) to detect various features in the images, using 3x3 filters and ReLU activation.
- **MaxPooling Layers:** Two layers with 2x2 pooling windows to downsample the feature maps, reducing spatial dimensions and computational load.
- **Flatten Layer:** Converts the 3D feature maps into a 1D vector to be fed into the dense layers.
- **Dense Layer (Hidden Layer):** Contains 64 neurons with ReLU activation to further process the flattened feature maps.
- **Dense Layer (Output Layer):** Contains 10 neurons with Softmax activation to produce a probability distribution across the 10 digit classes (0-9).

**Purpose:**

- **Image Classification:** Specifically designed for tasks involving image data. CNNs effectively capture spatial hierarchies and patterns, making them suitable for more complex datasets like the MNIST digit recognition.

### Key Differences

**Architecture:**

- **ANN:** Consists of fully connected (dense) layers. Suitable for general-purpose tasks where spatial hierarchies are not crucial.
- **CNN:** Incorporates convolutional and pooling layers, making it ideal for image data by capturing spatial features.

**Use Cases:**

- **ANN:** Best for simpler, general classification tasks, especially with non-spatial data.
- **CNN:** Tailored for image classification and tasks involving spatial data, offering better performance by leveraging convolutional filters to detect patterns.

**Complexity and Performance:**

- **ANN:** Simpler and quicker to train but may not perform as well on complex image data.
- **CNN:** More complex and computationally intensive but generally achieves higher accuracy on image-related tasks due to its ability to capture spatial relationships in the data.
